# UCI Math 9, Math 10, and Machine Learning

Proposed content for the Python portion of UCI Math 9, Math 10, and Machine Learning.

Summary:

* The first half of [Math 9](/math9) will continue to cover Matlab.  The second half will cover foundations of Python (unlike the current version, which covers Mathematica in the second half).
* [Math 10](/math10) will cover more foundations of Python, as well as basic principles of Machine Learning.
* [Machine Learning](/ml) will have a coding component, but its primary focus will be on the mathematical aspects of Machine Learning, including Deep Learning.
