Here we only describe the second half of the class, which will cover Python.  The first half of Math 9 is on Matlab.

## Week 6

Comparison with Matlab:
* Jupyter notebooks or Google Colab notebooks or Deepnote notebooks
* How to get help
* lists, indexing (it starts from zero) and slicing
* for loops, if statements, while loops
* functions
* positional arguments vs keyword arguments
* Very basic plotting in Matplotlib (it's similar to plotting it Matlab).

## Week 7

Data types
* list
* string
* dict
* tuple
* set
* int
* float
* bool
* function

Properties of data types:
* Is it immutable?
* Is it hashable?
* Is it iterable?
* Does it support indexing?

Introduction to NumPy
* NumPy array
* indexing
* broadcasting
* where
* The `axis` argument

## Week 8

Introduction to object oriented programming.  Defining our own classes.  What are *dunder* methods?

Random numbers in NumPy using `default_rng`.  Random simulations.  Comparison of speed of operations based on the data type.  Plotting results of speed tests using Matplotlib.

Basic image processing using NumPy arrays and Pillow, and displaying the results using Matplotlib.

## Week 9

What it means to write *Pythonic* code.  The DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Web-scraping using regular expressions.

Concepts used by experienced Python programmers:
* list comprehension
* f-strings
* lambda functions

Sorting using a key.

## Week 10

Catch up and review.

## Finals Week

Final exam (cumulative on both Matlab and Python).
